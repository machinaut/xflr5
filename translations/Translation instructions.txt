Procedure to follow for those who wish to translate the code to another language:

1. Download and install the QtCreator package from Nokia : http://qt.nokia.com/downloads

2. Launch QtLinguist which comes with the package

3. Load the xflr5.ts file

4. Select the destination language, then save the file with the appropriate extension
   For instance xflr5_pt.ts for Portuguese, xflr5_jp.ts for Japanese, etc.

5. Please notify the Project in case somebody else wishes to start the same translation, to avoid doing the work twice:
   x-andre at users.sourceforge.net

6. Translate the sentences (approximately 1480)

7. In TranslatorDlg.cpp, translate the word "English" to the name of the language, in that language. For instance, for a translation to French, "English" would be translated to "Fran√ßais"

8. If you wish to test the result : From the QtLinguist File menu, select "Release".
   It will generate a compiled file xlfr5_xx.qm, which is to be placed in the "translations" directory

9. Send the translated file "xflr5_xx.ts" to the Project

10. Occasionnaly, some translation updates may be required for future releases
